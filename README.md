Multi-Year Stock Data

The main task of this project was to use VBA scripting to analyze stock market data from 2014 to 2016. I was able to loop through multiple Excel worksheets (one per year) and calculated the yearly changes of the stocks (comparing opening and closing prices), the stocks yearly percent changes and the stocks total volume.  The addition task was to calculated which stock had the greatest percent increase, the greatest percent decrease, and the great total volume.
